							<h5>Initial Brainstorming</h5>
							We began our brainstorming with an exercise to determine all possible users of the site as well as any obstacles or skeptics that may work against the organization. 
							<br>
							These were organized into three groups: Those in Need, Those Helping, and Obstacles.
							<ul>
								<li>Those in Need:This category includes dog owners, animal shelters and people looking to foster or adopt.</li>
								<li>Those Helping: This category includes obedience/dog trainers, breed educators, spay/neuter advocates,animal shelters, animal advoactes, donors, and volunteers.</li>
								<li> Obstacles: This category includes the influence of stereotypes and bias, kill shelters, animal abusers, people who do not take responsibility for caring for a dog, pet stores, "designer" dog breeders, advocates against sprying/neutering, and people who would rather donate/help a human interest organization.</li>

						<h3>Interviews</h3>
						<h4>Client Interview</h4>
						<p> Client Contact: Amy Fabri</p>
